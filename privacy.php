                <h3>Social Plug-ins</h3>
                <p>We use website elements from Twitter, a social network of the company Twitter Inc. (1355 Market St, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA), on our website. Website elements are e.g. buttons (so-called "social plug-ins") or integrated content from the provider. You can find an overview of Twitter website elements here: 
                    <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="https://dev.twitter.com/web/overview">https://dev.twitter.com/web/overview</a></p>
                <p>We use Twitter elements to display posts and news about and by Open Knowledge Maps.


                    When you visit a page on our website that contains such a website element, your browser establishes a direct connection to the server of the provider. The content of the website element is transmitted by the provider directly to your browser and integrated into the Open Knowledge Maps page. By integrating the website elements, the provider gains knowledge that your browser has accessed the corresponding page of our website, and even if you do not have a profile with the provider or are not logged in at the time. This data (including your IP address) is transmitted by your browser directly to Twitter. If you are logged into one of the services, the provider can directly assign the visit to our website to your profile with this provider (see section "Cookies").
                </p>
                <p>Open Knowledge Maps has no influence on the parameters of the data that the Twitter lifts out with the help of the website elements. For details on the purpose and extent of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by the providers as well as your related rights and setting options for protecting your privacy, please refer to the privacy policy of Twitter: 
                    <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/de/privacy">https://twitter.com/de/privacy</a>
                    You would need to log out of each provider’s services if you want to prevent providers from directly associating the data collected through our website with your profile in that service.</p>

                <p class="bold">How to deactivate social plug-ins</p>
                <p>You can completely prevent the loading of the website elements with browser add-ons.</p>

                <h3>Links to third party websites and services</h3>
